                        <div class="card-body">
                            <p>So many of us think the source of fear is uncertainty. After all, there are so many
                                unknowns in life.</p>
                            <p>But before you address your fear, you want to know <i>why</i> you have fear before you
                                find a solution.</p>
                            <p>Most of us assume that uncertainty is the cause of fear. So what do we do? We try to
                                <i>remove</i> uncertainty by...
                            </p>
                            <p>• Getting every insurance policy possible
                                <br>• Obtaining degrees we think can give us better jobs
                                <br>• Working jobs that are supposed to look good on our resumes
                                <br>• Networking with people we think we need to survive
                            </p>
                            <p>What a waste of energy!</p>
                            <p>We are doing the wrong things while the answer is right in front of us. One of the most
                                fascinating thinkers of the 20th century is Jiddu Krishnamurti. He didn’t subscribe to a
                                particular philosophical movement, but his ideas were close to Buddhism.</p>
                            <p>Krishnamurti often said:</p>
                            <p>“One is never afraid of the unknown; one is afraid of the known coming to an end.”</p>
                            <p>How can you really fear something you don’t know? The problem is that we think we know.
                                And that’s true. Because you can definitely be afraid of what you think you know.</p>
                            <p><strong>Endings are Inevitable</strong></p>
                            <p>Back in the early 70s, music artists
                                made plenty of money through vinyl sales. It was followed by cassette tapes. Then the
                                compact disks (CDs) came in and music sales peaked for a good 21 years. Record labels
                                and artists earned a lot as their albums sold in the millions.</p>
                            <p>Then the
                                internet changed everything: Music piracy, file-sharing sites, and later streaming
                                platforms like Spotify or Apple Music made CDs, and the very concept of buying music
                                almost obsolete. It was the end of an era.</p>
                            <p><strong>Be free from Fear, embrace Endings</strong></p>
                            <p>In our modern and connected
                                world, we think we have the answers to everything. Remember when the Covid outbreak
                                started? It was fascinating to see how many things no one knew at the time.</p>
                            <p>A simple question like, “How is the virus transmitted?” caused so much debate that
                                everyone got confused. There was no single answer.</p>
                            <p>It’s the same when it comes
                                to self-knowledge. We’re such complex beings that it’s impossible to fully know
                                everything about ourselves.</p>
                            <p>One of the biggest sources of fear in the 21st century is what Krishnamurti called “the
                                fear from the known.” We fear that the things we’re attached to will come to an end.</p>
                            <p>Why fear something you know will happen?</p>
                            <p>“I don’t want it to happen!”</p>
                            <p>No one <i>wants</i> it. But by understanding reality and where your fear comes from, you
                                no longer will experience fear. </p>
                            <p>If you begin to understand what you are and what makes you afraid, you don’t need more
                                courage because you will feel secure in the midst of decay. You will have true
                                equilibrium.</p>
                            <p>Liberating, isn’t it?</p>
                        </div>

                        </h5>
                        <img src="images/psychology/closure.jpeg" class="card-img-top rounded" alt="">
                        <div class="card-body">
                            <p>Closure. What does that word even mean? The truth is, it will be different for everyone,
                                because closure is such a broad term in and of itself. Closure can come in many forms:
                                through the death of a relative, the loss of a friendship, etc.—but perhaps the most
                                known one, is closure when it comes to relationships. For some, it may mean finally
                                receiving an apology from an ex, giving your ex a glimpse of how much they hurt you, or
                                finally getting validation for your pain. Whatever the case may be, it’s believed that
                                getting closure will finally allow you to shut the door on the relationship and move on
                                for good.</p>
                            <p><strong>Here’s the thing, though, the cold, hard truth about closure: it doesn’t exist,
                                    and you will never get it with your ex. </strong>All of it is an illusion. The truth
                                is, closure can only come from one person and one person only: you. Below I shatter the
                                illsuion of closure and where the need for it comes from, and also break down how you
                                can truly get closure for yourself.</p>
                            <p><strong>Where the need for closure comes from:</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>• You feel the want and need to receive an apology.</strong> You may be feeling
                                like getting the apology you think you deserve will allow you to finally move on because
                                it will give you validate your pain and how much your ex hurt you.</p>
                            <p><strong>• You’re having difficulty coming to terms with the breakup.</strong> If you’re
                                having difficulty coming to terms with the breakup, you may have the desire to know why
                                it didn’t work out, where it all went wrong, and if you could’ve done anything
                                differently.</p>
                            <p><strong>• Your ego is still bruised.</strong> This is a subconscious form of
                                self-preservation. When your ego doesn’t get validated from a relationship and leaves
                                you feeling bruised, that anger and resentment will come in and cloud your mind. You’ll
                                end up feeling like you need to one-up, or find a way to get that validation and closure
                                you never received.</p>
                            <p><strong>How to get closure for yourself:</strong></p>
                            <p><strong>• Acknowledge your pain.</strong> All of your emotions are valid, and you don’t
                                need someone else to validate them. Be compassionate with yourself and give yourself
                                that acknowledgement. You don’t need another person to tell you that what you’re feeling
                                is justified.</p>
                            <p><strong>• Get comfortable never receiving an apology.</strong> The truth is, oftentimes,
                                people can’t admit any wrongdoing; and you need to learn how to forgive them on your
                                own. Years ago I saw a quote that said: “Forgive them. Not because they deserve it, but
                                because you deserve peace.” This is the way to give yourself closure.</p>
                            <p><strong>• Get comfortable in the unknown.</strong>It’s important that you find the
                                strength within yourself to accept that there are some things you may never know about
                                the time you spent with someone else.</p>
