                            <p><strong>Valentine's Day 2022</strong>: Some people have a hard time saying 'I love you'
                                to their partner. But it is not the only way to express love. The truth is doing little
                                things for your special someone can at times be even more romantic than poetry and love
                                letters, especially when you are hoping for this relationship to be long term or
                                'forever'.</p>
                            <p>There are innumerable ways to tell your partner the importance they hold in your life and
                                how
                                much you care for them. Afterall, if you want them to be a part of your life, you will
                                not
                                risk
                                taking them for granted, right?</p>
                            <p>For some people, a partner who's a great listener can be a major turn-on, while others
                                may
                                consider someone who respects their opinion more romantic than any other gesture.
                                Understanding
                                each other and connecting with each other emotionally and mentally are signs that your
                                relationship is heading towards the right direction.</p>
                            <p>If you are someone who wants his/her partner to stay in a relationship for long (or
                                forever),
                                Sara Kuburic, writer and psychotherapist has some tips for you.</p>
                            <p><strong>1. Give a compliment:</strong> A genuine compliment can light up any one's day.
                                It is
                                the
                                way of showing that you value and appreciate them and their gestures for you.</p>
                            <p><strong>2. Respect their opinions:</strong> Respect is a crucial aspect of a
                                relationship. If
                                you
                                respect your partner, he/she can feel comfortable around you and be themselves. People
                                who
                                feel
                                disrespected are unlikely to stay in a relationship for long.</p>
                            <p><strong>3. Accept when they say no:</strong> This is also part of respecting their
                                decisions.
                                Forcing decisions on your partner is a mark of immaturity and disrespect.</p>
                            <p><strong>4. Buy them cookies:</strong> The element of surprise spices up a relationship
                                like
                                nothing else in the whole world. Get them something nice to eat and it would be a
                                delight to
                                see
                                their happy reaction.</p>
                            <p><strong>5. Work towards resolving conflict:</strong> It is very common to have fights
                                between
                                partners. But it is how you resolve the conflict or your intention towards settling your
                                differences, that could make your partner feel special.</p>
                            <p><strong>6. Designate time for just them:</strong> `Some people make their partner feel
                                special by
                                waiting for them. Yes, you read that right. Waiting for them to come back from office, a
                                friend's place, an interview... Taking out time that is exclusively for your partner can
                                make
                                them feel valued and oh so special.</p>
                            <p><strong>7. Set boundaries:</strong> By setting boundaries, you are allowing your partner
                                to
                                have
                                their own life and a freedom to choose.</p>
                            <p><strong>8. Be honest:</strong> Without honesty, the foundation of a relationship will
                                always
                                be
                                weak. Being honest with your partner is a way of telling them that you can be trusted.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>9. Give them a hug:</strong> Hugging your partner is not only important for
                                physical
                                intimacy but also emotional. Give them a hug to show that you care and want them to be
                                closer to
                                you.</p>
                            <p><strong>10. Ask about their day:</strong> After a long day, asking about your partner's
                                day,
                                even
                                when your own day sucked, shows how much you care about him/her. A small question,
                                gesture,
                                or
                                an act can at times go a long way in setting the foundation of a relationship right.</p>

                            <p>The more we grow up, the more we face situations that demand us to be more mature with
                                the way we feel and the way we express our emotions. Lacking emotional maturity can lead
                                to lack of tolerance and absence of the sense of judgement and therefore, not being able
                                to tackle a situation. Emotional maturity also helps us to embrace ourselves the way we
                                are – imperfect and real.</p>
                            <p>Nicole LePera, Psychologist, who goes by the name The Holistic Psychologist on Instagram,
                                is known for breaking down complex human emotions with examples and also offer tips on
                                how to deal with our emotions more maturely. A day back, Nicole addressed the issue of
                                the importance of emotional maturity in life.</p>
                            <p><strong>It is okay to feel two different emotions about the same experience -</strong>
                                Nicole wrote that in case of a break up, we can feel angry and hurt and also miss the
                                person.</p>
                            <p><strong>It is okay to be unsure -</strong> It is not mandatory to have an opinion or take
                                a side with a situation. Being unsure is also a part of growing up</p>
                            <p><strong>Making mistakes is natural –</strong> It is okay to not be able to judge people
                                instantly, and we shouldnot beat ourselves when the person turns out to be different
                                than we thought.</p>
                            <p><strong>It is not mandatory to respond to every situation –</strong> Sometimes choosing
                                to be silent and embracing inner peace is also a mature decision to make.</p>
                            <p><strong>It is possible to be honest and empathetic at the same time –</strong> In case of
                                a situation where you feel that your truth may hurt the person, deliver it in an
                                empathetic way. That way you can be honest as well as not hurt the other person.</p>
                            <p><strong>Take a pause before your emotions get the better of you –</strong> Throughout the
                                day we feel a range of emotions. Sometimes it is healthy to take a pause and introspect
                                before letting our emotions control our behavior.</p>
                            <p><strong>Create healthy dynamics in life –</strong> Sometimes our parents can be wrong
                                too. They are also human beings who are dealing with their own unresolved trauma.
                                Emotional maturity also comes with the responsibility of creating a healthy space for us
                                and the people around us.</p>
