                        <div class="card-body">
                            <p><i>Ambitious people are a dime a dozen. Most people doubt themselves, and somewhere in
                                    this chaos, we all — in some shape or form — are stuck in our la la land.</i></p>
                            <p>One of the most difficult yet useful skills is the ability to balance your aspirations
                                with reality. A pessimist and an idealist both lack this skill. The point is to have
                                optimism about your future but look at the state of society, your environment, and your
                                circumstances without rose-tinted glasses.</p>
                            <p>Many of these truths sit right under your nose. Intuitively, you know they're true, but
                                facing them head-on means discomfort. Success or failure in life comes from which type
                                of discomfort you choose. You can choose the discomfort of facing reality, making
                                decisions to change, and having the difficult dialogue needed to do both. Or you can
                                choose the discomfort of rationalizing your situation, lying to yourself, and making
                                excuses. The choice is yours.</p>
                            <p><strong>The World Will Never Quit Poking You</strong></p>
                            <p>Have you ever felt like your circumstances were trying to break you?</p>
                            <p>Just when you’ve improved your finances, your car breaks down. You wake up on the wrong
                                side of the bed, come to work to a nagging boss and go home to an indifferent spouse.
                            </p>
                            <p>Every time you take a step forward, you take three back. Inevitably, just as you’re on
                                the rise, something or someone tries to knock you down.</p>
                            <p>If only life would give you a little bit of a break, you tell yourself, you’d have enough
                                energy to make an effort to become successful.</p>
                            <p><strong>Things Will Never be the Way They “Should” Be</strong></p>
                            <p>Should — what a simultaneously dangerous and useless word.</p>
                            <p>People often use should in one of two ways — to give themselves an excuse for not doing
                                something or for complaining about an unchangeable circumstance.</p>
                            <p>A perfect world doesn’t exist — the one without inequality, injustice, unfairness,
                                superficial people, hate, greed, envy, lust, the list goes on.</p>
                            <p><strong>No One is Coming to Save You</strong></p>
                            <p>When was the last time the government came to your rescue?</p>
                            <p>The answer is likely never. Yet we treat it like a savior or a demon when it’s neither.
                                It’s a machine. An uncaring machine that’s completely self-interested. Regardless, we
                                make our way to the voting booths to ensure our guy or girl wins.</p>
                            <p>Look at your own life. Has it changed dramatically between presidencies? Not in terms of
                                news coverage, but your actual life from day to day.</p>
                            <p>Odds are, you’ll have to lift yourself out of your circumstances. Will it be easy? Hell
                                no. But you really don’t have a choice — not if you want to change your life.</p>
                            <p><strong>Everything is Your Fault</strong></p>
                            <p>I know what you’re thinking. You were born poor, your parents didn’t treat you well, you
                                have a disability, you have a funny accent, you live in the wrong city, you’re sick,
                                your boss hates you, you have no money, you’re a disabled veteran, you’re black, you’re
                                a woman, you’re gay, you’re trans.</p>
                            <p>You’re special. And because your circumstances are so unique, you couldn’t possibly be to
                                blame for your failures. Deep down we know we’re the common denominator of all our
                                problems, but it’s hard to face. Why?</p>
                            <p>Becuase it means we’re the ones who have to change our situations. And if we don’t change
                                our situations, we can only blame ourselves. Nobody wants to think they’re the only real
                                barrier to their own success, happiness, and well-being. It’s easier to blame someone or
                                something else.</p>
                            <p>And no, I don’t think you’re lazy, mediocre, or “don’t want it bad enough.” It’s
                                genuinely difficult to take full ownership of your life. It can be uncomfortable or
                                downright painful. The natural reaction is blaming someone other than yourself because
                                your brain wants to protect you from harm and danger. But you can overcome these
                                excuses.</p>
                            <p>You’re in control of your life.</p>
                            <p>If you don’t take responsibility for your life, who will? I know how hard it is. Denial
                                feels bad, but it hurts a little less than accepting the truth of your role in your own
                                life. If you go through the painful period of acceptance and get up from the floor, I
                                promise greater things are ahead.</p>
                            <p><strong>Luck Plays an Important Role in your Life</strong></p>
                            <p>Wait.</p>
                            <p>Haven’t I spent much of this post telling you to take responsibility, believe in
                                yourself, and push toward success?</p>
                            <p>Why, then, would I say luck plays a large role in your life? Becuase it does.</p>
                            <p>If you re-do the lives on Warren Buffet, Mark Zuckerberg, and Bill Gates and change a few
                                variables, they don’t become mega-billionaires.</p>
                            <p>Buffet himself admits he was lucky to be born white, live in America, and be around when
                                the market went through a dramatic rise. Bill Gates had access to the right technology
                                at the right time. Without the Winklevoss brothers coming up with the idea in the first
                                place, there is no Facebook.</p>
                            <p>I’m sure all three would’ve been successful in some shape or form. They all went to Ivy
                                league schools. Still, the type of success they all have is rare.</p>
                            <p>Why am I bringing this up? For several seasons.</p>
                            <p>One, to show that things not going your way isn’t always a sign of your own failure. You
                                can create the right product or invention at the wrong time. You can have the ambition
                                but lack the right connections. The intentions and action can be there without the
                                result.</p>
                            <p>While all those statements are true, they’re still not excuses for quitting entirely.
                                Instead, you can use that knowledge to put less pressure on yourself and keep trying
                                until something works.</p>
                            <p>Rather than having a definitive path to success, you have odds. The best way to make the
                                odds swing in your favor is to play as many hands as possible. Unlike areal gambling,
                                you don’t have anything to lose, except for a piece of your ego or comfort.</p>
                            <p>You can make smart decisions to increase your odds. You can mitigate risk and plan
                                carefully to improve your chances of success. But nothing will guarantee it. Remember
                                that and move forward with the balance of optimism and realism we discussed in the
                                beginning.</p>

                            <p><i>Working remotely during the pandemic didn’t make us any more productive – digital
                                    intensity just made it seem that way</i></p>
                            <p>As large parts of the US workforce transitioned from conventional, office-based work
                                models to working from home last year, businesses grappled with the question of how the
                                shift would affect productivity.</p>
                            <p>Initial insights into productivity after the WFH transition were optimistic. In a 2020
                                survey of business leaders and employees conducted by The Wharton School, 82% of those
                                surveyed indicated that their teams maintained or exceeded pre-pandemic productivity
                                levels: 39% indicated that productivity remained at the same level as before the
                                pandemic, 34% reported that productivity was “somewhat higher,” and remaining reported
                                that productivity was “significantly higher.”</p>
                            <p>These studies relied on self-reported data from employees and managers who were
                                themselves in the thick of the WFO to WFH transition. More recent research suggests that
                                this perceived increase in productivity was likely a mirage, brought about by
                                increasingly hectic schedules, higher volumes of email, more frequent meetings and the
                                reality of working amid the distractions of home life.</p>
                            <p><strong>Busier doesn’t equal more productive</strong></p>
                            <p>A recent report from the University of Chicago compared productivity rates of 10,000+
                                workers prior to and after transitioning to a WFH model.</p>
                            <p>The subjects of the study are described as “highly skilled and educated” professionals,
                                who possess at least a bachelor’s degree in a field such as computer engineering or
                                electronics.</p>
                            <p><strong>Finding a way back to productivity</strong></p>
                            <p>Recent research from both the University of Chicago and Microsoft suggests that remote
                                work makes it more difficult for employees to maintain the same level of productivity as
                                when they work in a conventional office setting. The reason productivity declines in a
                                WFH environment is that managers and teams are compensating for the lack of in-person
                                contact by increasing the number of meetings and other forms of communication that
                                disrupt workers’ schedules and fragment their attention.</p>
                            <p>The shift to remote and hybrid work models is a major adjustment for most companies, and
                                we are just now starting to see the kind of data that can help us (re)calibrate our
                                strategies for fostering collaboration and communication outside the office. It is
                                already clear that we need tools, processes, and approaches that can help our teams
                                defragment and reclaim focus time whenever and wherever possible.</p>
