                            <p><i>Seven harsh truths to take back control of your career and start getting great
                                    opportunities.</i></p>
                            <p><strong>A boss can rob you of your most precious resource.</strong></p>
                            <p>Let me explain.</p>
                            <p>Bosses don’t work for you. Leaders do though. But, unfortunately, many of us work for a
                                boss, not a leader.</p>
                            <p>A boss cares mostly about the numbers, and getting their next promotion. Oh … and a big,
                                fat, juicy bonus.</p>
                            <p>The biggest mistake I saw in my corporate career was good employees waiting for their
                                boss to elevate them in their careers. So what happened? They wasted years of their life
                                — their most precious resource. One guy I worked with waited for his boss to move on for
                                5 years. They promised him he was the likely replacement. It was supposedly a done deal.
                            </p>
                            <p>Then in that 5th year upper management changed. His boss got fired and the new leaders
                                recruited one of their own. There was a changing of the guard. My colleague didn’t get
                                chosen. He’d never get chosen at that company. What he did wrong was rely on his boss.
                                Why don’t bosses care about our career growth?</p>
                            <p>They’re too busy with their own career to give a damn about yours. That’s the first harsh
                                truth you must accept to experience phenomenal career growth. Here are 6 more.</p>
                            <p>
                                1. Get what you want or make a switcheroo immediately. <br>
                                2. Your mental health is more important that your job title, salary, and reputation.
                                <br>
                                3. Good leaders are worth more than a high salary. <br>
                                4. We hate our jobs because we’re bored.
                                5. A career is a team sport. Become a connector instead of a competitor. <br>
                                6. There’s an alternative to following the rules of the career ladder. Don’t wait for
                                permission. Write your own damn permission slip.

                            <p><i>I’m a huge fan of New Year’s resolutions, especially actionable ones.</i></p>
                            <p>Instead of “count my blessings,” I resolved to write a thank you note every week for a year.</p>
                            <p>The year started off fairly easy: Each week in January and February, I picked a close friend or family member and described in a handwritten note why I was grateful to have them in my life. I purposefully didn’t put return addresses on them; I didn’t want anyone to think I was expecting a response. Sometimes I heard back anyway: a phone call, a message on Facebook. Most of the time I didn’t, but I didn’t mind. I was happy just to be putting those feelings out into the world.</p>
                            <p>But by March, I struggled to think of people I hadn’t written to yet. I started resenting the task, and I put it off, my weekly note rolling over into the next week and the one after that until I was facing a stack of four blank cards to fill.</p>
                            <p>Then it dawned on me that, without really meaning to, I’d restricted my thank yous to the personal sphere. When I decided to extend my resolution into my professional network, I found a wealth of people there to thank.</p>
                            <p><strong>Making Thank You's a Routine</strong></p>
                            <p>I’ve been a freelance writer for about ten years. In that time, I’ve written countless emails: pitching stories, seeking sources, following up with folks who’ve ghosted me, tracking down late payments weeks, months, or years after the fact. While I love the flurry of activity, one drawback is that the squeaky wheel usually gets the grease. I’m not proud of it, but I’ll admit that I don’t usually take the time to follow up with the people I’ve worked with—even the ones I really  <i>should</i> thank.</p>
                            <p>For example, I often find myself needing a clear, concise quote from a source with highly specific knowledge in a matter of hours. While of course I say “thank you” when we speak, I've always intended to reach out to these experts and the publicists who represent them when a story finally runs, thanking them again for their help and sharing the final product. Too often, however, by the time this happens, I've moved on to my next assignment, my attention consumed by another rapidly approaching deadline.</p>
                            <p>So I decided to be proactive. Each time I filed a story, I took a moment to make a list of the people instrumental to it and drafted the emails I planned to send once the article was published. It was easy enough to remember to add a link when it went live and hit send.</p>
                            <p>Sometimes, I got no response at all or a simple “thanks!” back. But one PR rep I wrote to thank for help locating a source followed up with a list of other clients she was working with, which ultimately led me to find the perfect source for an upcoming story. Regardless of the responses, I kept it up, and soon, sending thank yous became so routine that instead of one a week, I was often sending four or five a day. My new system had made it so easy that I stopped counting these as part of my resolution.</p>
